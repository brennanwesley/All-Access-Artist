# Comprehensive Split Sheet Data Fields

A **Split Sheet** is a foundational legal document in the music industry. Its primary purpose is to clearly define, in writing, who owns what percentage of a specific musical composition (the song itself, separate from any single recording of it). This document is created by the songwriters and producers and is used to register the song with Performing Rights Organizations (PROs) and publishers to ensure everyone is paid royalties correctly.

## Song Information
*This section contains the basic identifying metadata for the musical work.*

* **Song Title:** The official, final title of the composition.
* **AKA (Also Known As):** Any alternate titles the song might be known by.
* **Date of Creation:** The date the song was completed or the date the agreement is being made.
* **Length:** The duration of the song (MM:SS).
* **Studio / Location of Creation:** The place where the song was written.
