## Latest Updates (v4.0.0 - 9/1/25)

### ✅ Stripe Subscription Integration - COMPLETED

**41. Complete Stripe Subscription System Implementation**
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Full StripeService integration with product creation, customer management, checkout sessions, and webhook processing
- **Subscription Routes**: Complete API endpoints for status, checkout, cancellation, and products (`/api/subscription/*`)
- **Webhook Handler**: Secure Stripe event processing with signature verification at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Access Control**: Admin/test user hardcoding with read-only mode for expired subscriptions
- **Security**: No payment data stored locally - Stripe Checkout handles PCI compliance

**42. Subscription Access Control Matrix**
- **Admin User** (`brennan.tharaldson@gmail.com`): Full access always
- **Test User** (`feedbacklooploop@gmail.com`): Hardcoded active subscription (temporary)
- **Expired Users**: Read-only mode blocks all mutations (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
- **JWT Authentication**: Maintained with user-scoped database access via RLS

**43. Stripe Product Configuration**
- **Artist Plan Product**: `prod_SyIOZerF9U5Xx5` 
- **Monthly Subscription**: $9.99/month recurring
- **Features**: Unlimited releases, analytics, label copy generation
- **Environment Variables**: Configured on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend)

### ✅ Navigation and Routing System Overhaul - COMPLETED

**44. Complete Navigation Infrastructure**
- **Protected Routes**: Added `ProtectedRoute` wrapper for authentication-required pages
- **Error Boundaries**: Implemented React `ErrorBoundary` for graceful error recovery
- **404 Handling**: Added catch-all route (`*`) for unknown URLs with styled NotFound page
- **Route Coverage**: Complete navigation system handles all user paths without dead ends

**45. Enhanced Loading States and UX**
- **Route Transitions**: Full-screen loading skeletons during navigation
- **Error Recovery**: Retry/home options in error boundary with user-friendly messaging
- **Navigation Context**: Fixed route detection logic for release detail pages
- **Loading Indicators**: Enhanced ReleaseDetail with proper loading states

### ✅ Page Layout and Styling Fixes - COMPLETED

**46. App.css Container Constraint Resolution**
- **Root Cause**: `#root` had `max-width: 1280px` constraining entire app
- **Solution Applied**: Removed max-width, margin, and padding constraints from #root
- **Result**: Full-width content area properly fills viewport minus sidebar
- **Impact**: Eliminated black space, dark gray content area now spans full width

**47. Layout Architecture Improvements**
- **Sidebar**: Remains perfectly formatted (unchanged)
- **Main Content**: Now utilizes full available viewport width
- **Responsive Design**: Proper component spacing across all screen sizes
- **User Experience**: Eliminated cramped UI components and narrow content areas

### ✅ Data Validation and Error Handling - COMPLETED

**48. ISRC Validation Fix**
- **Issue**: ISRC codes failing validation at 12 character limit
- **Standard Format**: `CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN` (15 characters with hyphens)
- **Solution**: Updated Zod schemas to allow 15 character ISRC codes
- **Files Updated**: `backend/src/types/schemas.ts` - both CreateSongSchema and CreateLabelCopySchema
- **Result**: Label copy saves now succeed for standard ISRC formats
