# Comprehensive Analysis: Release Management Components

*Analysis Date: August 17, 2025 - Updated for v2.3.0*

## Overview

This document provides a thorough analysis of the three core release management components in the All Access Artist platform, examining their architecture, API connections, and readiness for the upcoming build.

---

## Component Architecture Overview

### 1. ReleaseCalendar.tsx - Main Dashboard Component

**Purpose:** Primary release management interface with timeline view and quick stats

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **State Management:** Uses TanStack Query via `useReleases()` hook
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Comprehensive loading, error, and empty states
- ✅ **UI/UX:** Modern glassmorphism design with skeleton loaders
- ✅ **Navigation:** React Router integration to release detail pages
- ✅ **Modal Integration:** Triggers `NewReleaseModal` for creation

**Data Flow:**
```
ReleaseCalendar → useReleases() → apiClient.getReleases() → Backend /api/releases
```

**File Location:** `frontend/src/components/ReleaseCalendar.tsx`

---

### 2. ReleaseDetail.tsx - Individual Release Management

**Purpose:** Detailed view for managing individual releases with tabs and tools

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Dynamic Routing:** Uses `useParams` to get `releaseId` from URL
- ✅ **API Integration:** `useGetReleaseDetails()` hook for detailed data
- ✅ **Tabbed Interface:** Checklist, Songs, Lyric Sheets sections
- ✅ **Conditional Rendering:** Metadata prep modal integration
- ✅ **Complete Tabs:** Songs and Lyrics tabs fully functional with CRUD operations

**Data Flow:**
```
ReleaseDetail → useGetReleaseDetails(releaseId) → apiClient.getReleaseDetails() → Backend /api/releases/{id}
```

**File Locations:** 
- Component: `frontend/src/components/ReleaseDetail.tsx`
- Page: `frontend/src/pages/ReleaseDetail.tsx`

---

### 3. NewReleaseModal.tsx - Release Creation Form

**Purpose:** Form modal for creating new releases with validation

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Form Validation:** Zod schema with React Hook Form
- ✅ **TypeScript Safety:** Strict typing with inferred form data
- ✅ **Mutation Handling:** `useCreateRelease()` with optimistic updates
- ✅ **Error Display:** API error alerts and form validation
- ❌ **Hardcoded Artist ID:** Uses `'temp-artist-id'` placeholder

**Data Flow:**
```
NewReleaseModal → useCreateRelease() → apiClient.createRelease() → Backend POST /api/releases
```

**File Location:** `frontend/src/components/NewReleaseModal.tsx`

---

## API Connection Analysis

### Current API Architecture

- **Base URL:** `https://all-access-artist.onrender.com` (fallback)
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer tokens via Supabase Auth
- **Error Handling:** Standardized `ApiResponse<T>` interface
- **Query Management:** TanStack Query for caching and state

### API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `/api/releases` | GET | ReleaseCalendar | Fetch all releases |
| `/api/releases/{id}` | GET | ReleaseDetail | Fetch release details |
| `/api/releases` | POST | NewReleaseModal | Create new release |
| `/api/tasks/{id}` | PATCH | *Referenced* | Update tasks |

### Data Type Mismatches

**✅ FIXED:** Schema now standardized across all components:

**All components now use:**
```typescript
release_type: 'single' | 'ep' | 'album' | 'mixtape'
status: 'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'released'
```
